## Financial Planner

This tool is designed for financial planning.
It should be used for indicative purposes only and is not financial advice.
Actual results may significantly differ from simulated values.
This tool, methodology, and code behind it are based on my personal judgment and do not reflect
the views of any other institution.

The Financial Planner lets you estimate how much you should invest for a comfortable retirement.
Given your input data, it will simulate a portfolio value until the end of your retirement.

### Description and methodology

At the first stage (before retirement), it's assumed that you invest a constant amount of money.
At the second stage (after retirement), it's assumed that you only withdraw from your
investment account.

The simulation is based on historical US **equity data** from
[Shiller's website](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm).
It assumes that your investment portfolio consists of 100% US equity stocks (S&P 500).

All values are in **real** terms (adjusted for inflation).
This is possible because Shiller's data contains both real and nominal returns.
It's convenient, as we can view our portfolio value in today's money without
needing to adjust for inflation.

Please note that taxes and fund fees are not taken into account.

We use bootstrapping to simulate 100,000 scenarios.
By default, we use data from the post-World War II period (starting from 1949-12-31).
We assume that yearly returns are i.i.d. (but not (log-)normal).
Data from {hist_data.first_date.year} to 2023 ({hist_data.num_timesteps} datapoints)
has an average yearly return of {hist_data.mean * 100:.1f}% and
volatility of {hist_data.volatility * 100:.1f}% (skewness {hist_data.skewness:.1f}).

The main chart below displays mean and median portfolio values.
Mean and median diverge significantly because our portfolio value becomes right-skewed.
It's best to use the median over the mean for this kind of long-term financial planning.
It tells you the minimum amount of money you should expect to have in a given year
in 50% of the cases (or, equivalently, the maximum amount of money in the worst
half of the scenarios).

Even better, you should check the 25th (or 5th) percentiles,
which are available in the table below. The 5th percentile represents the
Value at Risk (VaR) at 5%. You can interpret it as the portfolio value in a bad long-term
market environment.
